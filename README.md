# Employee-Directory-Public-API
Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory.

Get 12 random people from the Random User API.

Arrange them in a matrix, displaying core information. When a user is clicked on a modal appears and displays further information about the user. When the modal is open, next and previous navigation is available to traverse employees in the list.

A filter box is also available to filter the list of employees based on first and last name matches. The filter results can be cleared and reset to the original list of 12.

Used the fetch() feature. This app won't work in IE 11, but it will in Edge. Orther major browsers have been tested.
